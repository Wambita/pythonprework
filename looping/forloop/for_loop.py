#A for loop is used when one wants to repeat something a number of times. Just like the if statements, blocks of code in a for loop are indented, otherwise they will not run.

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)

letters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h'] 

for letter in letters:
    print(letter)
