# for loop with range and strings
for i in range (0,11):
    print("I would love " + str(i) + " cookies")
#Here we created a loop that prints out the string I would love cookies with the number of cookies incrementing with the for loop. We used the str() method to convert the number i to a string so that we could concatenate it with the rest of the string
