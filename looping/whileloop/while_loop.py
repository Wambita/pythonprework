#We've created a variable players that we set as 11, and then created a while loop with the condition that the value of players needs to be greater than or equal to 5. If this condition is true, then a string will print and the value of players will decrease by 1, and the loop will execute again until the condition is no longer true (that is to say, players is less than 5).
#Sure enough, the code only executes when players is greater than or equal to 5. After that, the while loop is exited and the code stops running.
